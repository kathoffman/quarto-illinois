# Title-Only Slide

You can also include text under the slide, but you should reserve the first header just for section changes. 

## Sample Slide Title

### Example of a subtitle

We can create unordered lists:

- first item 
    - A sub item

Or ordered lists

1. Ordered list first item
    1. Nested list item

Or **bold**, *italic*, or [URL](https://illinois.edu) text.

## Mathematics

Inline mode: $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$

Display mode: 

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

## Columns

We could also split content between two columns:

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
Left column
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
Right column
:::

:::

## Code Highlighting

For continuous highlighting, use `from-to` (`6-8`).

For discontinuous highlighting, use `line1, line2, ...` (`1, 4`).

To highlight lines in a progressive manner, use `range1|range2` (`|1,4|6-8`). 

```{.python code-line-numbers="|6|9"}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Enable more revealjs features

The theme is built ontop of Quarto's `revealjs` implementation. So, any [features](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) of available are also usable within the theme. For example, if we wanted to incorporate the [chalkboard](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#chalkboard) feature. We would use:

```yaml
format:
  washington-revealjs: 
    chalkboard: true
```

## Summary {#sec-summary}

### UW-themed presentation slide deck

The Quarto University of Washington Revealjs theme is an extension of Reveal.js and
offers all of its [features](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) in the context of being brand friendly at UW.

Install the theme without this template:

```bash
quarto install extension kathoffman/quarto-uw
```

Install the theme with the template being present:

```bash
quarto use template kathoffman/quarto-uw
```
